There are so many wonderful places to explore on campus. If I had to pick my top three though they would be **Allen Library, the Quad, and the HUB**. 


## Allen Library 
Allen library is one of my favorite spots on campus because it is a wonderful space to study. I enjoy the wide open table, so that I can have space while doing my work. I also very much enjoy how quiet it is at all times. The enviroment of Allen Library really keeps me focused and allows me to get alot done. I also often times choose to sit by a window, so I can soak in our beautiful campus while studying. 

## The QUAD
The quad is another one of my favotire places on campus because it is always busy with people and the brick buildings that surround it have beautiful charm. No matter what season it is something is always happening in the Quad. 

### Fall
In the fall the quad really displays the back to school energy with events like club rush happening there. 
### Winter
In the winter the quad is a wonderful place to enjoy the week of snow that we get.

### Spring
The spring is by far the most beautiful time to enjoy the quad as the cherry blossoms bloom. People come from all over the world to take in their beauty. 

## The HUB
The hub us always a great place to catch up with a friend after class. You will most definitely see someone you know there. It's also a great place to grab a coffee or bite to eat.
